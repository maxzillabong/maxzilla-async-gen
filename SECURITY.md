## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities under the latest major version. Ensure you are on the most recent release to receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities privately.

1. Email max@maxzilla.nl with the details (include proof-of-concept if possible).
2. Allow up to 72 hours for an initial response.
3. We will work with you to assess the issue and publish a fix.

Do **not** create public GitHub issues for security problems.

Once the fix is released we will credit you (if desired) in the release notes and changelog.
